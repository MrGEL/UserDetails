Steps to deploy UserDetails web service...

1) Install mongodb drivers...
   - Go to https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community and download the install package ( without SSL ) best
     suited to your machine spec.
     Eg: Windows 64-bit .msi installer.
   - Once downloaded, take the necessary steps to start the installation process.
     Eg: Right click .msi file and install.
   - Make sure to choose the Complete setup type and not Custom.
   - The destination folder is typically "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\X.Y\Bin" where X.Y is some version number.
     If you cannot find the installation folder just do a search for mongo.exe from your root folder.
   - Now we need to create a data folder where our mongodb will be housed.
     Eg: "c:\data\mongodb"
   - Open up a command window and browse to the bin folder for mongodb.
   - type the following command...
       mongod --dbpath "c:\data\mongodb"
       or whatever path you created for you mongodb.
   - Upon success the last line of text should read along the lines of ... waiting for connections on port 27017.
   - Type Ctrl-C to exit, ie: shutdown the db engine.

2) Install nodejs...
   - Go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and download the the install package best suited to your machine spec.
     Eg: Windows Installer (.msi).
   - Once downloaded, take the necessary steps to start the installation process.
     Eg: Right click .msi file and install.
   - Follow the setup wizard, taking note of the install folder for node.js.
     You can change this if you want. Make sure you install everything.
   - Restart you machine.
   - You may now start using node.exe to run node.js services.

3) Install the following node.js modules...
   - Create a source folder to keep you node services.
     Eg: c:\NodeSource.
   - Open a command window and browse to your source folder.
   - Install the following 3 node.js packages from the command line...
       npm install express
       npm install mongodb
       npm install body-parser
     ...noting that there will be a short wait for each install.
   - On completion, your should have a new subfolder in you source folder called node_modules which will contain
     3 subfolders for the modules you just installed.
